            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The young wizard walked with a heavy heart, oblivious to the hustle and bustle that filtered through the tall purple glass windows. His steps, slow and listless, were directed, as every year around that time, towards the highest floor of the tower.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The beautiful structure rose haughtily into the sky, defying all the surrounding buildings, challenging even the mountains that protected it. Inhabited by numerous apprentices and various masters, it functioned as a magic faculty and power center, an imposing place in the middle of the vast world that ruled it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_4/FOTO%201.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The boy let out a sigh, he didn't want to attend the magic show, he didn't want to face the rest of his peers, he had never been good at it, and this year was not going to be an exception. He cursed under his breath the wicked tradition that forced all students to gather and demonstrate their progress in front of the teachers, he hated that day, hated being forced to do something he hated.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">He squared his shoulders as he reached the huge wooden door and nervously grasped the knob, his feelings mattered little, he could do nothing to change the customs of that place, much less someone like him. He gave several light blows and waited.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">-Ahead! Pass! He heard them shout from the other side.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">He looked helplessly at his hands and entered the great room, crestfallen, he already knew the result of what was going to happen.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_4/FOTO%202.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">"I failed again," he said, approaching an old wizard who was waiting for him by one of the large windows.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The teacher shook his head, revealing a mixture of sadness and disappointment in his eyes. His young apprentice seemed to voluntarily evade a fundamental part of his teachings, it is the magician's will that controls magic and not the other way around. As long as he did not believe in himself and his abilities, he would not be able to become the person he was destined to be.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">"Next year you will try again," he said, in a tone that seemed to admit no reply.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">"Next year I will get the same result," said the boy, unable to look his mentor in the eye. I am not as good as they are, "he said, pointing bitterly at the group of apprentices," I will never be.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">"You don't want to be," his mentor replied, placing a hand on his shoulder, "and until you don't want to yourself, you won't be."</p>

            <h4 class="text-center blog-entry-title">"DonÂ´t be 'a writer'. Be writing."<span>&nbsp;- William Faulkner</span></h4>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I do not dedicate myself professionally to writing and perhaps, much to my regret, I will never do it, but I like to write. I like to create worlds and dream stories, build little universes on a handful of blank pages, even though I can't spend as much time on them as I would like. Because time is, unfortunately, limited, and my work consumes a large part of it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_3/FOTO%202.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Combine a busy life and a demanding job with a hobby like writing is complicated, it forces you to juggle with the little time you have, sometimes almost non-existent, to find a time to write. I do not know how the rest of the part-time writers were organized, in my case it is, at least, a challenge.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Sometimes, I think that like the rest of humanity, I have wished that the day had more hours, that the weeks counted more days, and that they were less work, but I have not been successful, I have had to resign myself to the immutable reality, that twenty-four hours cannot be stretched for more than one wants.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Getting a time to write, in my case, is usually a matter of encouragement, time and disposition. Sometimes, more often than I would like to admit, none of them accompany me and tiredness ends up winning a game that, illusively, I thought I had won. But I am not resigned, and I keep looking for moments that allow me to sit down to write, to fill hours and pages with what I really enjoy.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Several years ago I read, and I think I have seen it repeated in countless places, that you learn to write by reading and, above all, by writing, that the more time you spend writing the better results you will get. I want to believe that such a statement is true, even if it plays against me, even if I don't have the time it takes. I want to believe that the more stories I finish, the more points and endings I type, the better the following will be, and I will become, little by little, a good writer, or at least acceptably good.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_3/FOTO%203.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">In a way I know that is true, if I compare my first stories, my first book, with the last of my works, I can clearly see the progression, and that same progression is what encourages me to keep trying to improve, to keep looking for that time that sometimes I lack. Because you learn to write by writing, and I should do it ... Until next time!</p>

            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">How many times have you started writing a story and discarded it after several chapters or even pages? How many stories have you  abandoned halfway?</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I did many.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_2/FOTO%202.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I started writing when I was very little, stories, stories, just a few pages and always at hand. With the passage of time I started with longer texts, my ideas were more ambitious and the computer made the process much easier. However, as size grew, so did neglect.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The ideas came flying and eagerly asked to be put on paper and I obediently opened a new document and emptied everything that appeared in my head. I loved those moments, the excitement for starting something new, the excitement for building different worlds, unknown characters. But just as they came, they left, leaving me to my fate, with the only company of the dreaded blockade. Seconds, minutes, and maybe an hour in front of a blank screen, an empty page, and the irremediable decision came: I can no longer continue with this story.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I must admit that the situation was frustrating, wanting to write, dreaming of finishing a book and being able to hold it with my hands, and feeling that I was not capable, that perhaps I never would be.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Over the years, a little more maturity and some discipline, I realized the real problem. The only culprit for the blockade that I blamed all my failures was me, I was not an ethereal and invisible entity determined to see me suffer, I was plain and simple, the author of my own sabotage. There was no planning in my writing, no fluency, but a kind of happy chaos that pushed me to write a certain number of words to throw them into oblivion after several weeks.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">And one day I understood that I had to change the way of thinking about writing, the very way of writing, that I had to start organizing myself, to take it seriously.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_2/FOTO%203.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">My first complete draft came along with several changes in my life, fruit of the certainty that, if writing was my dream, I should at least try to achieve it. It was not easy, but I decided not to stop until I reached my goal. I prepared the characters in advance, the world and the chapters, and I promised to sit every day at the keyboard.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">It was a long way (my first story has a little more than 190,000 words) and, sometimes, complicated, but I fulfilled what was promised and I can't be happier. The result of that first attempt has not yet seen the light, although I hope that one day it will be able to do so, but it taught me more than I expected and showed me that, if I wanted to, I could also achieve it.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">For me the most important stories, good or bad, are those that end. A draft can be edited, edited and modified hundreds of times and then published. An unfinished story is condemned to die in oblivion.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Thanks for stopping by the blog and ... Until next time!</p>

            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Welcome to my corner in the infinite world of the cloud, I would invite you to take a seat, but you probably already have.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">My name is Blanca, a novice writer in my spare time, and a lawyer in those who are not. I started writing a long, long time ago, when I had the ability to pick up a pencil, a piece of paper and capture the stories that were going through my head. Almost all of them were, and continue to be, fantastic, where the real and the unreal mix and coexist, where the imagination is the only one that dictates the rules and sets the limits.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_1/FOTO%202.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">However, and despite the countless words my fingers have typed and typed, it has not been until now that I have decided to formally expose one of those stories. "You were the Chosen One" is not the first book to which I put an end, but it is the first that I have had the courage to self-publish. And speaking of self-publishing ...</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">When I decided to start this adventure, conscious of not having any professional help, I had a finished manuscript, and the false assurance that launching it into the world would be a quick and easy way. "What difficulty can there be," I said to myself at the time, "in laying out and preparing a text? How complicated can it be to design a cover?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_1/FOTO%203.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">My innocent and naive perception of the process of preparing a book for publication was founded on the absolute certainty that I could find any information I needed in the vast world of the internet. So I took my manuscript, sat down at the computer, and got fully involved in the above procedure.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Ah! How soon my two assumptions fell, that was not going to be a simple way, much less fast. But there I was, ready not to be intimidated by complications and problems, prepared to spend hours and hours choosing measures for the margins or space between the letters. Because layout, especially when it is going to be published on paper, is not just to justify a paragraph, it is to watch widows and orphans (what names!), To know that it is better to start the chapters on an odd page, that you have to leave pages As a courtesy, prepare text styles so that the chapters are navigable in the ebook format. In short, an endless list of points to keep in mind that I was completely unaware of.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">After several YouTube tutorials, countless blogs and tips on how to edit your book, and endless hours in front of a screen, I requested my first paper copy from Amazon.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="pb-1">
            <img class="d-flex mx-auto m-2 blog-entry-img" src="assets/images/blog/entry_1/FOTO%204.png" alt="blog-img">
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">The copy arrived on a sunny day, there was nobody at home to receive it, so I had to go pick it up at the Post Office. I left before work, to make sure I could get to her on time, what an illusion! It was the first book I was going to have on paper, like a real one, like one of those sold in bookstores, but this time it was going to bear my name.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I opened it with impatience and a smile on my face, which disappeared when flipping through the first pages and seeing the terrible margins I had ended up choosing, the visible black line on the spine and the mismatch in the number of chapters.</p>
            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">Lost the initial illusion, but not willing to let myself be overcome by the obvious failures and, I think inevitable, as a novice, I returned to the editing and layout process. More hours choosing the size of the margins, more hours squaring the centimeters of the cover, more hours laying out the chapters.</p>

            <p class="m-0 blog-entry-text">I know that everything can be improved, and the road ahead of me is long, I am also aware of everything I have learned with this book and everything I have left to learn, but, for now ... I did it!</p>
