### Strategy
The goal is to diseminate the site user towards their goal as soon as possible (via an intuitive navigation bar). But at the same time we want to promote the latest book launched in a very visual and attention gathering way to expand insterest (via hero content).

Defined and clean navigation with clear section titles:
