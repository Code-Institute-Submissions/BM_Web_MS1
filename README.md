# Blanca Mármol Webpage
Fantasy writer

**(MS front-end project - Code Institute by Ángel González)**

This is the website for an indie fantasy author. The site includes a showcase of her publishings and information about them as well as options to see reviews and proceed to purchase. The domain also includes a blog section and an about section with information like biography, next events or social feed. Finally, there's a contact section for fans, event or enquiries.

## UX
### User stories
Users of this webpage will be both fans and editors/commercials browsing the writer content for possible engagement in events and/or contracting.

### Strategy
The goal is to disseminate the site user towards their goal as soon as possible (via an intuitive navigation bar). But at the same time we want to promote the latest book launched in a very visual and attention gathering way to expand interest (via hero content).

Defined and clean navigation with clear section titles:

Small device navigation is collapsed and clean when opened:

![Navbar-phone-open](/assets/images/screencaptures/Navbar_smart-open-min.jpg "Phone browser")

### Scope
We want to take the make it easy for the users to access the different section that they were searching and also make them know the author's latest work to potencial the selling and also amplify interest.

### Structure
Header and footer stay fixed keeping the user familiar with the site environment. The main section is what changes from one page to the other:

* "home", displays the latest launched title and a peak of the author's agenda
* "titles", allows browsing through the author publishings
* "reviews", allows browsing through the publishings public reviews
* "about", includes full agenda, the author biography and a social feed
* "blog", displays the author's blog with an index
* "contact", allows contacting the author via a form

### Keyframes
Some original keyframes designed with the writer. Style improved overall during w.i.p.

### Surface
Color pattern following the latest book launch is kept consistent throughout the site with contrast and complimentary colors when needed for indicators, cta's and hover effects.

## Technologies Present
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.x)

## Features
This domain profits of some Bootstrap features like the fixed navbar and footer. Also the collapsable navbar itself and the carousel, present in a couple of the pages. Overall responsiveness is also based on the Bootstrap grid system.

### Future Features Objectives
As the project didn't involve anything but HTML and CSS, I didn't implement but kept for future practice/development:

* Real time social feed in about.html (Jquery code to present a real time feed instead of having to manually update)

* The Carousel feature will be replaced by interactive tabs, making it easier to target from one page to the other making the relation between titles.html and reviews.html closer in order to facilitate transference from one to the other easing UX

* Making contact.html form actually work with PHP and DB

## Testing
Users can successfully access to the whole domain and navigate through it in an easy and intuitive way. Response works fine for all davices. 

Every link creates a new tab avoiding connection with the site to be interrupted. 

Contact also can be made with the writer in both ways, formal through form, or informal via social media provided on footer icons.

### Notes
In general, scrollbars dont work off "-webkit" browsers.

On reviews.html, users that submitted reviews are made up and links go to generic sites to avoid personal information issues.

Also take account that, despite all required fields to press "submit", the form in contact.html doesn't do any "action" and has no "target" either.

## Deployment
This site is temporarily hosted on GitHub Pages, from Master branch.
